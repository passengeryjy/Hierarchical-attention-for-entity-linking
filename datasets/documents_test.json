            "document": "is it possible that aliens might look like the one depicted in ridley scott movies .possible sure it is a big universe but will they look like that almost certainly not in another answer i explained how steven king while creating it and probably also enjoying far far too much drugs stumbled on a truth for us to imagine aliens everything we are imagining is really just some strange combination of things we have seen here on earth it is almost impossible for us to imagine something that alien so what did king create a telepathic alien composed of energy who lives .no not really in fact it is exceptionally unlikely here is an interesting factoid about life on earth these three animals all evolved from animal something that crawled out of the sea a few hundred million years ago and stayed out of it each and every one of them have the same chemical makeup in their bones heck they have not cartilage or some wibbly-wobbly musculature like an octopus each one also has a spine and five fingers yup all of them even the giraffe and four legs this does appear to have happened more than once as evidenced by insects and worms which are .yes in fact in the wagon of there are life forms living across the vastly limitless universe they can be in forms we can think of let me explain how many planets could you think of that can harbor life in our neighborhood milky way galaxy thousands tens of thousands billions trillions countless how many exist in the observable universe 10 100 millions countless how many galaxies exist the observable universe so all the creatures all alien life forms of all science fiction literature on earth from .i disagree with those who think humanoid aliens will prove vanishingly rare i think the universal dynamics of darwinian selection will result in a substantial percentage of technological alien species being roughly humanoid in configuration not as many as sci-fi movies imply but nonetheless an appreciable portion reason what is the essence of the humanoid configuration and its functioning the compact central body offers a fortified repository for most vital organ systems and clusters them close together for their mutual interactions the compact front-end head provides the brain .no no possible way the xenomorphs in scott is movie designed by are far too humanoid the reason for it was explained in the later movie prometheus but that explanation is incoherent and impossible real aliens if they exist will not look humanoid at all .no real aliens would look almost unrelated to humans the alien from the ridley scott movies have human dna because of its hosts who were all human aside from the dog alien i like the concept of the alien taking on the hosts dna but even the dog alien host of the alien is a dog has humanoid features since the dog alien still retains human features it tells me that the alien creature is related to humans planet earth in some way and that means aliens from outer space who developed independently from earth are in no way shape or form going to resemble the xenomorphs in alien .it is always been indicated that xenomorphs pick up dna from their hosts and from covenant we know that the first true xenomorphs had some human dna as do the engineers and all the ones seen in the alien movies come from that source so they are going to have some very basic human features it is also important to actually understand what a xenomorph is it is not an animal that developed naturally a xenomorph is the creation of the twisted artificial mind of david it is specifically designed to produce fear loaning and death in humans and engineers it is physical form does not have to be .",

            "document": "how reliable were cromwell tanks in combat during ww2 what was the general opinion of the cromwell against the sherman among soldiers .the cromwell was fast low slung and reliable it was a popular tank and served postwar for example in korea the original cromwell was designed to take a 75 mm high velocity gun but was not big enough to take the weapon ref 1 so always lacked anti-tank firepower in terms of protection the cromwell was slightly worse than the m4 owing to the unsloped armour albeit it was a smaller target however .from the national interest allied tanks were engineered for mass production and to handle routine battlefield tasks well rather than being over-engineered to survive the heaviest guns or penetrate the thickest armor by the allied victory over nazi germany was won on the back of well over tens of thousands of medium tanks churned out by allied factories over the course of the war these war-winning weapons stemmed nazi attacks from the gates of moscow to tunisia and the battle of the bulge and swarmed in .the cromwell was an okay tank one has to question the r d process that allowed this one can only guess the headaches involved in this process of designing a tank to carry a gun then building the turret so it can not be fitted odd comparing the cromwell to the sherman is really a poor thing to do by the time the cromwell was introduced for the .the cromwell was reliable by british standards but not on the same level as the m4 i have read 2 anecdotes of instances in regards to british tankers being returned form the mediterranean theater where they crewed m4s and being assigned cromwells in britain 1st anecdote a british officer was very vocal in his displeasure about being assigned a cromwell he was order to be silent on the issue or he would be reassigned and flagged for no future promotion 2nd a british sergeant was also very vocal in his displeasure about being assigned a cromwell he was told to be silent or he would be .a cromwell was not as reliable a tank as a late-model m4 sherman however cromwell crewsopinions varied and depended on more factors than reliability although you are correct that that quality was likely to be any tanker is top priority a cromwell accelerated very well and had a high top speed compared to a sherman and british tankers of the time loved to fire and maneuver likewise while not exactly cutting a low profile like a stug it at least was not conspicuously tall which helped in defensive scenarios .this does not have anything to do with the question but i thought that the author of said question might be interested in this video it makes the case that a somewhat similar british tank the churchill specifically the crocodile variety was the best weapon of ww2 not that it was able to win air supremacy or level who cities in seconds rather it had a very specific role and it accomplished it perfectly and with deadly effect .",

            "document": "what is it like to fight an american soldier how does the enemy view the u s soldier can you give an example preferably using insurgents .i once spoke to a somali living in dublin who told me he witnessed and took part in the day of the rangers or the battle of mogadishu in 1993 i did not press the matter as apparently he lost two of his cousins to us helicopter fire support he only survived cos he dived under a 4x4 and the engine block saved him he walked with a slight limp as an armour piercing 5 56mm rifle round fired by a us rifleman near one of the helicopter crash sites passed straight through his left femur about 3 finger widths above the knee and took him out of the fight after it killed a neighbour in front .it would be best to get an enemy insurgent to answer or an american soldier who has interrogated some but based on accounts i have seen and literature available it seems the general attitude of non-western insurgent fighters to us troops or british or israeli troops for that matter is that they are not that formidable if you take away their airpower armor artillery technology etc while this is an attitude that many opponents take into battle it is one they are quickly disabused of once in combat as i noted in a post about hezbollah fighting the israelis despite propaganda in .my mother insisted that my father brought himself out of the royal marines when the vietnam war started as she did not want to go through another war with my father atacked by our american friends again thank you us rangers because i was born as a result she had good reason to fear our american friends because of their gung-ho what we now call blue on blue accidents and my father considered them to be poorly trained trigger happy fools with too much equipment unlike the generation who had fourght in the second world war the new recruits had lots of confidence lots of .against the u s marines navy seals and army rangers and elite units the taliban who are very savvy insurgents in afghanistan and the insurgents in iraq tended to avoid prolonged fire fights unless they had a distinct advantage in numbers when such fire fights did occur the insurgents ran the risk not only of superior american marksmanship and fighting discipline but also of close air support a-10s have particularly been brutal on the insurgents war for u s marines navy seals and army rangers and elite unit has anything been but a fun vacation fire bases cannot be considered .from my experience as an american soldier and knowing a bit about our roe in both iraq and afghanistan i can say that several answers have touched on some aspects of the us army tactics and general rules to be somewhat short there is an overarching rule that is passed down concerning roe from overall command however for specific instances in specific units the rules do not apply something called sop is or standard operating procedure every unit decides on how it does a particular task given an environment and conditions within that environment a transport company and an infantry .the last 8 years under president obama our military was weakened severely our military leaders hands were tied behind their backs because the goofy obama administration required all decisions to go through dc bureaucrats who had zero knowledge or military training horrible strategy and a formula for failure our generals are amongst the smartest and morally objectionable people we have in our society in other words if we can not trust them who the hell can we trust to lead our young men and women surely not stuck up elite college aged liberals i know we are better off now under trump .",

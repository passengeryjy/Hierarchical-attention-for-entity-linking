            "document": "why is there a shortage of qualified workers in the united states .there is not one answer to this question there is a shortage of workers in the skilled trades the number during the 2016 election was 5 5 million the last i heard it was 6 5 million so the shortage is growing worse at a terrific rate because the problem has been building for a long time and the last generation of americans who saw trades as a good option is reaching retirement age americans are obsessed with college almost every county in the us has a community college with facilities that rival top universities in many countries pick any city of 100000 or so in the country and there .first these are my opinions based upon a lifetime of experience and observation feel free to disagree contest or add to them there are two main reasons for the lack of qualified workers in the us lack of apprenticeship programs and lack of career advancement paths within many industries which are a result of what i call corporatism first you have to understand how public education got started at the beginning of the industrial revolution there was a major lack of skilled labor to work in the newly established factories and most smaller towns were a single factory town it was to .based on my anecdotal experience there is not one i will preface this by saying that i am not in high-tech or it where this problem seems to be more salient there does indeed exist a mis-match in qualified workers willing to commit to jobs that under-pay very often i will hear from businesses i can not find or keep qualified workers i then ask what is your starting pay they respond with some figure that is surprisingly low given the qualifications called for in the job announcement i have seen this at my own workplace surprise surprise dollar 38000 is not enough to attract people with a .why is there a shortage of qualified workers in the united states hog wash bandini there has never been a shortage of qualified labor at least in my life time any shortage would have been solved by paying more so americans would seek those jobs have seen people with masters degrees doing administrative paper work look at all of those people that work in the medical insurance billing field the rich came up with a scheme to beat down the power of labor anybody that works for someone else for a living cut government spending force women in to the work place brake unions hire .there is a mismatch between the skills for which there are many available jobs and the workers to fill them you can not take a burger-flipper from mcdonalds and plup him into a programmer job he is not trained for it even if you could offer the burger-flipper free training and a stipend for living during his training he may not have the mental horsepower to do a programming job there is a mismatch between the places where there are jobs and the places where there are qualified workers you can not offer a farmer from mississippi a farming job in california he lives in the wrong state so .",

            "document": "had the sixth army not been encircled and trapped at stalingrad would the germans have eventually won the battle .according to my dad who was a transportation command officer with a battalion of trucks in stalingrad no he said november of 1942 was really the end of the war he had seen the secret reports by the army and navy that germany was out of fuel and that the romanian fields could not keep up neither could synthetic fuel he was for a time an engineer working on that not the well-known fischer-tropsch process but the bergius process from coal he was occasionally attached to the organization todt for construction projects he said there was no time to build factories for that and they .no army group b the group the sixth was part of had a strategic goal of astrakhan 250 miles southeast of stalingrad the goal was to eliminate all soviet resistance west of the river volga from stalingrad to the astrakhan this was needed to protect the main push army group a was tasked with seizing 80 percent of the ussr is fuel reserves in the caucasus the army group b had exhausted itself in the drive east to stalingrad over 200000 casualties with over 50000 of those deaths there were halted for long periods because they were out of supplies logistics were not keeping up .no defeat was inevitable and the reason was oil there is a strong argument that germany is chronic shortage of oil was the key driver behind hitler is decision to launch barbarossa when he did both hitler and the russians understood that germany needed access to the caucasian oil fields before the end of 41 or she would run dangerously low on oil and lose her capacity to fight effectively hitler is initial instinct was to drive south to secure the oil and food supplies of the caucasus and the ukraine however the wehrmacht convinced him to prioritise the offensive on moscow but losing .no do not forget the battle of stalingrad was never supposed to be a battle stalingrad the idea behind the southern thrust was for army group b including the sixth army to secure fuel reserves in the caucasus the end objective was astrakhan 400 kilometres away the fact that the sixth army ended in stalingrad at all was a failure in itself as to whether or not the sixth army could have held on to stalingrad i do not think so the other battles of the eastern front show time and time again that the sheer weight of a soviet offensive would have crushed german resistance .a recurring theme in questions about wwii is change x situation outcome on the ground do the germans win now the answer is almost always no the fact is the germans lost the battles they lost and the war because of factors of logistics supply industrial production and population numbers and hitler is tendency to get preoccupied the germans were encircled and trapped in stalingrad because the axis forces supporting them were under-equipped under-supplied and few in number allowing the russians to break through if the russian is had not however the german losses in stalingrad .no there were two battles of stalingrad and the germans lost both of them everyone knows about the second encirclement battle but many do not know that even before the encirclement the germans were stalled in early november 1942 with 90 percent of the city and the german sixth army fought out specifically isolated soviet positions held out until about november 10 1942 when ice started forming on the volga that meant two things 1 the soviets would soon be able to transport supplies and reinforcements across the whole river and not just across one ferry under heavy fire 2 .what do you mean by won arguably the germans should have bypassed stalingrad but given the logistics problems described so well in several posts here it is doubtful that they could have achieved their final objectives besieging stalingrad was a huge mistake as it was a question of fighting the russians on their own terms in urban combat like borodino it was a slogging match the kind of fight that the russians liked and had the numbers to ultimately win while napoleon won at borodino it was a strategic defeat in terms of his losses given that germany was desperately short of .",
